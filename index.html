<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
    around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
        unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the horse came back
    bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t
        that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q
            class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong></q>, and the
    farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around
    to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors
    came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q
            class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> —
    because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
    consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.<br/><br/>Alan Watts

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="conclusion"><span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
        class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</p>
